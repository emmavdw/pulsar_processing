Overview
This script processes and visualises pulsar data from a PSRCHIVE archive file (L2049635_SAP000_B000.med). It generates a 2Ã—2 figure with four different plots to analyse the pulsar's behaviour across pulse phase, frequency, and time.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python3
- PSRCHIVE (psrchive module)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Generated Plots
The figure contains four visualisations:
- Fully scrunched pulsar profile: Flux density over pulse phase.
- Phase vs Frequency plot: Shows how the pulsar signal changes with frequency.
- Phase vs Time plot: Tracks pulse phase variations over time.
- Dynamic Spectrum: Displays flux variation across time and frequency.
